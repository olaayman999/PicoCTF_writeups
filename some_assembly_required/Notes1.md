## what is javascript obfuscation 
JavaScript obfuscation is the process of making JavaScript code difficult to understand or reverse-engineer. This is often done to protect intellectual property, hide malicious code, or make it more difficult for others to copy or modify the code. Obfuscation techniques can include renaming variables and functions, minifying code, and using code obfuscation tools.

## how to know if code is obfuscated 
There are several ways to determine if JavaScript code has been obfuscated:

1-The code may look jumbled and difficult to read, with variable and function names being replaced with random characters or numbers.
2-The code may be significantly shorter than the original, which could be a sign that it has been minified.
3-The code may contain a lot of unnecessary or hard-to-understand characters, such as non-alphanumeric characters or characters from different scripts.
4-Using code beautifier tools to format the code, it will be clear if the code is obfuscated.
5-You can use JavaScript obfuscation detection tools, which analyze the code and determine if it has been obfuscated.
Keep in mind that just because code is obfuscated, it does not mean that it is malicious. Some developers obfuscate their code to protect their intellectual property or prevent others from easily copying or modifying it.

## steps of deobfuscation
The steps for deobfuscating JavaScript code can vary depending on the specific obfuscation techniques used, but some general steps that can be taken include:

1-Use a JavaScript beautifier tool to format the code and make it more readable.

2-Rename variables and functions with more meaningful names to make the code easier to understand.

3-Look for patterns in the code, such as repeated structures or function calls, that can help you understand how the code works.

4-Use a JavaScript deobfuscation tool, which can automatically reverse some of the more common obfuscation techniques.

5-Understand the code flow by using a JavaScript debugger, this way you can see how the code is executed and how the data flows.

6-If the code is heavily obfuscated, it might be necessary to manually analyze the code, which could include understanding how the code uses encryption, compression, or code obfuscation techniques, and then reverse engineering those techniques.

Keep in mind that the process of deobfuscation can be time-consuming and may require a significant amount of expertise in JavaScript and reverse engineering.

## what does await WebAssembly do
await WebAssembly is a JavaScript statement that is used to wait for the completion of a WebAssembly module instantiation.

WebAssembly is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. It is designed as a portable target for the compilation of high-level languages like C, C++, and Rust, enabling deployment on the web

A WebAssembly module can be loaded and instantiated using JavaScript's WebAssembly.instantiate() function, which returns a promise that resolves to an object containing the WebAssembly module instance and its associated exports. The await keyword is used to wait for the promise to resolve and to access the instantiated module's exports.

So in this line 
```javascript
await WebAssembly[findMiddlePosition(479)](await leftBranch[findMiddlePosition(474)]()) 
```
it is likely that the function returns a promise that resolve to the exports of the WebAssembly module.
